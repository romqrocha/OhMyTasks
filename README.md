# OhMyTasks
A simple application for keeping track of tasks.

## Overview
I made this project for testing Copilot's integration with MCP servers.

By using MCP servers, LLMs can call functions that provide additional real-time context to their input. 
From my tests, I noticed this can prevent hallucinations and keep the LLM up to date on information that would otherwise be completely out of its scope, such as the user's current time or a GitHub repo's latest issues.
