Testing Copilot's integration with MCP servers.

By using MCP servers, LLMs can call functions that provide additional real-time context to their input. 
I've noticed that this can prevent hallucinations and keep the LLM up to date on information that would otherwise be completely out of its scope, such as the user's current time or a GitHub repo's latest issues.
